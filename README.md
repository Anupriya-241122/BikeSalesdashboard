# BikeSalesdashboard
This repository contains data analysis of Bike Purchasing Behavior and  Sales Report.
I'm glad to present my latest project: the Bike Sales Dashboard.The inspiration for this dashboard comes from Alex Freberg's YouTube Excel series.
The main goal of this dashboard is to provide valuable insights into the sales performance of bicycles. Its user-friendly interface allows stakeholders to access the necessary information effortlessly and promptly.
Here are the key business insights derived from the data:

1-To increase our market share, we should target individuals residing in Europe and the Pacific region, particularly those with a commute distance of 5 miles or less. They are more likely to require a bike.

2-Middle-aged customers (30-55 years old) show a higher propensity to purchase bikes. Therefore, we can focus our marketing efforts on this demographic, as they are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products.

3-The data indicates no repeat customers. To boost sales, we can target these customers for repeat orders, as their family members may also be interested in purchasing a bike.

4-Customers with an average income below $56,000 (males) and $53,000 (females) are more likely to forgo making a purchase. Thus, we should prioritize targeting customers with a relatively higher average income.

5-Single customers have a higher conversion rate compared to married individuals. Therefore, targeting single individuals could lead to increased sales.
              
By leveraging the Bike Sales Dashboard, I have gained the ability to make data-backed decisions like never before.
I am eagerly seeking your valuable feedback. Please leave a comment to share your thoughts. Your feedback is highly valued and appreciated.
